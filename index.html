                Hello there! My name is Nived, and I am a first-year computer science engineering student at Government
                Model Engineering College Thrikkakara. I have always been passionate about programming and building new
                things, and I love the feeling of solving complex problems using lines of code.

                What really gets me excited is the intersection of programming and design, and that's why I have a
                strong
                interest in UI/UX design and app development. I believe that a great user experience is just as
                important as
                great functionality, and I am always striving to create apps and websites that are both visually
                appealing
                and easy to use.

                As I continue to learn and grow as a programmer, I am constantly seeking to expand my skill set and
                explore
                new technologies. Whether it's front-end web development, mobile app development, or anything in
                between, I
                am always eager to take on new challenges and build innovative solutions.
